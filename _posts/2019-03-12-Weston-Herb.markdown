intro: "Doctor, Human, Necromancer"
---
**Background** Sage

**Race** Human

**Class** Wizard - School of Necromancy

|   **Personality Traits**  | I have read scores of books around to learn all I can in Medicine. To push my abilities further I must enhance my medical practice with the Arcane, to prolong the lives of myself and anyone willing. |
|   **Ideals**              | Knowledge. The path to power and self-improvement is through knowledge. (Neutral). |
|   **Bonds**               | I have an ancient text that holds terrible secrets that must not fall into the wrong hands. |
|   **Flaws**               | I am easily distracted by the promise of information. Unlocking an ancient mystery is worth the price of altering civilization as we know it. |

<h1>Motivation</h1>

Weston spent most of his life as a Doctor, known for his experimental surgeries which sometimes justified their means, but often left his patients no better off.
Despite having no desire to stop his practice, Weston was politely asked to start his retirement a few years early.

<h1>Abilities</h1>

<p>Weston was an experienced and practical Doctor. He now seeks out sources of undeath to further understand how to animate the recently deceased, to put the undead to work and to extend mortal life.</p>

<p>Adventuring is a sure way to do so and he may have the opportunity to continue his medical practice throughout.</p>

|   STR   |   DEX   |   CON   |   INT   |   WIS   |   CHA   |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 9 (-1) | 13 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 15 (+2) | 11 (0) |

<p>As for all characters his suggested stats come from the standard skill point array: 9, 13, 14, 16, 15, 11.
They are assigned in the order: <i>Intelligence</i>, <i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Constitution</i>, <i>Dexterity</i>, <i>Charisma</i>, <i>Strength</i>.

<p>His Human heritage gives him +1 to all stats (already included).

<p>High highest stat is <i>Intelligence</i> having obsessively dedicated decades to study and memorisation.

// TODO Missing arm 

Taking the <i>Healer</i> feat at level 4 or at level 1 by changing his race to Human (Variant), is an excellent way of playing Weston as a surprisingly effective healer whilst his animated undead attack for him.

<h1>Class</h1>

<p>Weston's obsessive nature and aptitude for learning make him an effective <i>Wizard</i>, however
Players may choose to refrain from raging, given Rubeus' mission to control his anger. 
Rubeus however may come to understand the value of letting his passion flow from time to time in a tense situation.</p>

<p>Rubeus wields a <i>Greataxe</i> and swings so wildly given his inexperience with combat. Whilst he has seen comparatively little violence compared to the likes of his fellow adventurers, 
he has played the role of many soldiers and kings. He is therefore familiar with stage combat. 
One day he may find himself picking up a <i>Greataxe</i> or other sharp weapon. 
This would certainly be a step towards a more permanent lifestyle of adventuring.</p>
