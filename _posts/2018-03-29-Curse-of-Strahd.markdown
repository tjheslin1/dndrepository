<p>The following are the the letters included in the Curse of Strahd adventure.</p>

<p>I am in the process of typing this out on a typewriter, to hand out to players.
These letters also serve a more readable version than the images in the back of the adventure book.</p>

<p>With permission from Wizards of the Coast I will be making them available here:</p>
