**Background** Entertainer

**Race** Half-elf

**Class** Barbarian

|   **Personality Traits**  | I know a story relevant to almost every situation. I'll take any opportunity to tell of my past roles in plays and shows. |
|   **Ideals**              | This world is a test of my resolve. |
|   **Bonds**               | I would do anything for my fellow actors, I've come to the same opinion of my fellow adventurers. |
|   **Flaws**               | A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around. |

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rubeus-letter.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rubeus-letter.png" alt="I've played Merlin, Strahd and countless more. So I'm sure I can convincingly play whichever nobody from around here you want me to.
I am a classically trained actor. The theatre mostly. Up on the stage, my arena, I was divine. You should have seen me! A few too many.. incidents.. left the Actor's Guild no choice but to turn their backs on me.
I accept that.
One day I hope to prove myself worthy of their company and place in the Guild. Until then I must learn to control my anger, before it truly ruins me. My rages have not been without their uses however. I have saved myself from more than a few.. predicaments.. in the past."></a>

<h1>Abilities</h1>

<p>Rubeus was a successful actor before being excommunicated from his acting guild due to his fits of rage and violence.
He now seeks to understand and control his anger.</p>

<p>Adventuring is a sure way to do so and he may have the opportunity to flex acting skills too.</p>

|   STR   |   DEX   |   CON   |   INT   |   WIS   |   CHA   |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 16 (+3) | 10 (0) | 15 (+2) | 8 (-1) | 12 (+1) | 15 (+2) |

<p>As for all characters his suggested stats come from the standard skill point array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
They are assigned in the order: <i>Strength</i>, <i>Constitution</i>, <i>Charisma</i>, <i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Dexterity</i>, <i>Intelligence</i>.</p>

<p>His Half-elf heritage gives him +2 <i>Charisma</i> and +1 to two skills which I assigned to <i>Strength</i> and <i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>Whilst a master of learning lines of characters he performs, he otherwise doesn't have the highest <i>Intelligence</i>.
His anger has led to many altercations leaving him strong and muscular, this is reflected in his highest stat being <i>Strength</i>. 
Years of acting allow him to persuade many through his high <i>Charisma</i>. In particular Rubeus makes use of his <i>Disguise Kit</i> and <i>By Popular Demand</i> features of his <i>Entertainer</i> background.</p>

<p>After years of living the high-life as a successful thesipan, Rubeus has not yet shunned his ways and continues to wear formal clothing. Smart trousers, a shirt and waistcoat which tends to become undone during his rages. Likewise his swept back hair fuses with sweat and hangs over his face whilst he sees red.</p>

<h1>Class</h1>

<p>Rubeus naturally fits a Barbarian and at level 3 <i>Path of the Berserker</i> is a fitting choice. Players may choose to refrain from raging, given Rubeus' mission to control his anger. Rubeus however understands the value of letting his passion flow from time to time in a tense situation.</p>

<p>Rubeus wields a <i>Warhammer</i>. Whilst he has seen comparatively little violence compared to the likes of his fellow adventurers, he has played the role of many soldiers and kings. He is therefore familiar with stage combat. One day he may find himself picking up a <i>Greatsword</i> or other sharp weapon. This would certainly be a step towards a more permanent lifestyle of adventuring.</p>

|   **3rd Level**   | Path of the Beserker |
|   **4th Level**   | <i>Actor</i> feat. |
